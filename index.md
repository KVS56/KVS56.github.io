# What's this and who are you?
Hey there! I'm Krishna Vaibhav Sharma. It looks like you've stumbled on my little corner of the internet. There can be any number of reasons why that happened. You may already know me. In that case, you may have looked at someone else's site, and thought: 
> Impressive, very nice, now let's see Krishna's personal website.

Or, you may have seen it linked somewhere. In which case, you may have thought:

> Not all  projects are broken.

Or, you may not know me at all. If you don't, allow me to entertain you for a little while, so I can change 
that. You'll know me - at least a little bit.
