# What's this and who are you?
Hey there! I'm Krishna Vaibhav Sharma. (I also sometimes use the name Parsel. It wasn't mine, actually, in the beginning.) It looks like you've stumbled on my little corner of the internet. There can be any number of reasons why that happened. You may already know me. In that case, you may have looked at someone else's site, and thought: 
> Impressive, very nice, now let's see Krishna's personal website.

Or, you may have seen it linked somewhere. In which case, you may have thought:

> Not all projects are broken.

Or, you may not know me at all. If you don't, allow me to entertain you for a little while, so I can change 
that. You'll know me - at least a little bit.

As you may have estimated from my moderately obscure literary refrences at the top of the page, I love reading books. As in, I read voraciously. At any given time, the number of books on my To Be Read list is always increasing, despit my reading 4 books at once.

Not only do I read a lot, sometimes I can be found penning (or typing) down my daydreams. Mostly i just end up daydreaming _about_ writing though.

## Some stuff I've written:

- [The Mountain View](./mountainpeak.html)
- [Apokalypso](./apokalypso.html)
- [Sur la nature des hommes](./afewlines.html)

This is all poetry, but I also write essays and prose. I haven't put any online though, at the moment. If you have any reviews/comments, you can either email me at zeparselmouth@gmail.com or wait until I implement a commenting platform. You can also check out my crappy code projects on my Github account. (My username there is KVS56.)
 
My other interests include reading and pondering philosophy. My interest here comes from a desire to become capable of understanding reality in its purest form.
My views mostly stem from rationalism, but I have my existentialist days.

I also created [this webpage](./counter.html) to make a sort of philosophical point about humanism and how invaluable lives are constantly being lost. In retrospect it is also somewhat morbid, but that is to be expected, as I made it after reading [this document](https://www.yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda), written by Eliezer Yudkowsky, as a monument to his brother Yehuda. Please also see [this page](./randomquote.html).

This website is not yet complete. Your suggestions can find me at not only the above email address, but also at sharmakrishnavaibhav@gmail.com. Things I mean to add, but haven't yet:

- [ ] Implement a comment section
- [ ] Add a place for me to record musings in the form of blog posts
- [ ] Add insights and analytics
