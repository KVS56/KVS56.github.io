## Sur la nature des hommes

_all the arguments in the world_

_epitome of rhetoric and reason_


_cannot overcome one_

_charged with emotion_


_men do not seek the best and greatest_

_but that which provides the most dopamine_


_nor disdain the worst and meanest_

_but that which they haven't seen_
