## The Mountain View

_Fair and known fields do the heart gladden
Yet the sights of heights unexplored a dreamer madden

Tall the peaks & snowy white the slope
Oh, to conquer that mountain I do hope

For these fields many do daily walk
But of the eagle's perch even the ambitious only talk

Ere my youth is gone amd tired old age sets in
The great mountain's crown I must win_
