## The Mountain View

_Fair and known fields do the heart gladden

Yet the sights of heights unexplored a dreamer madden_


_Tall the peaks & snowy white the slope

Oh, to conquer that mountain I do hope_


_For these fields many do daily walk

But of the eagle's perch even the ambitious only talk_


_Ere my youth is gone amd tired old age sets in

The great mountain's crown I must win_
