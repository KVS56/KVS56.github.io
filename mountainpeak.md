## The Mountain View

_Fair and known fields do the heart gladden_

_Yet the sights of heights unexplored a dreamer madden_


_Tall the peaks & snowy white the slope_

_Oh, to conquer that mountain I do hope_


_For these fields many do daily walk_

_But of the eagle's perch even the ambitious only talk_


_Ere my youth is gone amd tired old age sets in_

_The great mountain's crown I must win_
