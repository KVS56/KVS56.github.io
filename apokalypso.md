_Whirlwinds all around_

_Little sunlight to see in a storm_


_In the eye it is peaceful yet worse_

_Every carriage looks like a funeral hearse_


_A pen isn't a mouth that can scream_

_All it can do is be a bad copy_


_But isn't this all just replicating what can never be cloned by man_

_Where is the true original, know that you never can_


_Is there any perfection_

_Or is the world all broken_


_But it looks as though there are angels in hell_

_Angels that can't hear the tolling bells_
